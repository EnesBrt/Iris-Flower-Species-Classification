# Iris Classification Project

This project aims to classify Iris flowers into three different species (Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica) based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the well-known [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris), which consists of 150 samples with 50 samples from each of the three species. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all measured in centimeters.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you need the following libraries:

- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:
